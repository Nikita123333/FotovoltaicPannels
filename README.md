# Photovoltaic installation
  The task of this project was to design a residential photovoltaic installation for a single-family home. The entire project was completed using the PVsyst software. In this program, three simulations were conducted: in the first, 14 modules were installed on the building's roof, in the second, everything was the same except power optimizers were used, in the third, a different arrangement of modules was implemented, which resulted in greater shading of the modules. The attached files include a technical description and three reports of the conducted simulations.
